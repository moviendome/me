          <p>A decade ago, if someone had told me I'd spend the next ten years of my life exploring and living across Asia, I probably wouldn't have believed them. Yet here I am, looking back at a journey that transformed not just my career, but my entire perspective on life and work.</p>

<p><img src="/10-years-in-asia/lumpini-park-bangkok-thailand.webp" alt="Lumpini Park in Bangkok, Thailand" /></p>

<h2 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h2>

<p>It all began in Madrid, where I was working as a Software Engineer, following what many would consider a "traditional" career path. During a local tech meetup, a casual conversation introduced me to the concept of <em>"Digital Nomads"</em> - a term I'd never heard before. The speaker mentioned an organized trip called <a href="https://www.hackerparadise.org/" target="_blank">Hacker Paradise</a>, offering a two-month stay in <strong>Bali</strong> and <strong>Chiang Mai</strong>. Something about it instantly captured my imagination.</p>

<p>Without much hesitation, I applied for the program. When the acceptance email arrived, reality hit: I needed to convince my employer to let me work remotely for two months. Looking back, that conversation with my boss was the first step toward a completely different life.</p>

<p>Before this adventure, my travel experience was limited to the usual European city breaks with friends, a holiday in <strong>Japan</strong>, and a week-long trip to <strong>San Francisco</strong> for a <em>Ruby</em> conference. But this was different. I was about to spend two months in countries I knew little about, working while exploring places I'd only seen in travel blogs and magazines.</p>

<p>The first month in <strong>Ubud, Bali</strong>, was like stepping into another world. The lush greenery, ancient temples, and the unique blend of traditional and digital nomad culture created an environment I'd never experienced before. Then came <strong>Chiang Mai, Thailand</strong>, with its perfect mix of ancient culture and modern amenities. Being surrounded by other remote workers, developers, and digital entrepreneurs showed me a different way of living and working.</p>

<p><img src="/10-years-in-asia/doi-inthanon-national-park.webp" alt="Chiang Mai in Thailand" /></p>

<p>The most profound impact wasn't just the places themselves, but the people I met. Here were individuals from all over the world who had broken free from the traditional 9-to-5 office life, creating successful careers while exploring the world. Their stories, achievements, and lifestyles opened my eyes to possibilities I never knew existed.</p>

<p>When I returned to Spain, I knew my life would never be the same. The comfort of home felt different now - not uncomfortable, but somehow incomplete. My mind was already planning the next adventure, not just for a few months, but permanently.</p>

<h2 id="a-journey-across-continents">A Journey Across Continents</h2>

<p>Six months after my return to Spain, I embarked on what would become a year-long journey across Southeast Asia. This time, I approached travel differently - slowly and deliberately. Each destination became more than just a place to visit; it became a temporary home.</p>

<p><img src="/10-years-in-asia/ko-lanta-beach-thailand.webp" alt="Ko Lanta Beach in Thailand" /></p>

<p><strong>Ko Lanta's</strong> peaceful beaches and <strong>Bangkok's</strong> vibrant streets in <strong>Thailand</strong>. The bustling energy of <strong>Ho Chi Minh City</strong> in <strong>Vietnam</strong>. The digital nomad haven of <strong>Canggu</strong> and the paradise-like <strong>Gili Islands</strong> in <strong>Bali</strong>. The ultra-modern cities of <strong>Japan, South Korea, and Singapore</strong>. Each location offered its unique flavor of life, and I stayed anywhere from two weeks to several months, depending on how deeply the place resonated with me.</p>

<p><img src="/10-years-in-asia/tokyo-tower-japan.webp" alt="Tokyo Tower in Japan" /></p>

<p>After nine months of Asian exploration, I briefly returned to Spain to reconnect with family before joining something completely different - the <a href="https://www.nomadcruise.com/" target="_blank">Nomad Cruise</a>. Sailing from <strong>Las Palmas in Gran Canaria to Santo Domingo</strong> in the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong>, we stopped at Caribbean jewels like <strong>St. Martin, Antigua, St. Lucia, and Barbados</strong>. These were places I'd only dreamed of visiting, yet there I was, working from paradise.</p>

<p>Following the cruise, I found myself in <strong>San Jose</strong>, a beautiful beach place in my hometown that offered a perfect winter retreat. But Asia called again, this time leading me to join <a href="https://remoteexplorers.com/" target="_blank">Remote Explorers</a> for two months in the <strong>Indian Himalayas</strong> - an experience that added yet another dimension to my journey.</p>

<p><img src="/10-years-in-asia/hoi-an-vietnam.webp" alt="Hoi An in Vietnam" /></p>

<p>The next phase of my journey took me to <strong>Penang, Malaysia</strong>, before I finally settled in <strong>Chiang Mai, Thailand</strong>, for two years. This longer stay provided a perfect base for exploring more of Southeast Asia: the charming cities of Vietnam like <strong>Danang, Dalat, Hoi An, and Hanoi</strong>; the modern metropolis of <strong>Taipei</strong> in Taiwan; the multicultural hub of <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>; the laid-back capital of Laos, <strong>Vientiane</strong>; the vibrant city of <strong>Hong Kong</strong>; and even ventures into China's massive cities of <strong>Beijing and Shanghai</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/from-the-busy-bangkok-to-the-quiet-ko-samui/ko-samui.jpg" alt="Ko Sumui Views from the Villa, Thailand" /></p>

<p>In 2020, a new chapter began when I accepted a job in <strong>Bangkok</strong>, where I've been based ever since - except for a memorable six-month escape to <strong>Ko Samui</strong> during the Covid pandemic, where I lived in what I can only describe as my dream villa.</p>

<h2 id="finding-home-in-thailand">Finding Home in Thailand</h2>

<p>After experiencing so many incredible places across Asia, it's <strong>Thailand</strong>, and particularly <strong>Bangkok</strong>, that has captured my heart these past five years. There's something special about this country that goes beyond its famous beaches, temples, and food.</p>

<p><strong>Bangkok</strong>, with its perfect chaos of traditional markets and modern skyscrapers, of street food vendors and high-end restaurants, of ancient temples and contemporary art galleries, offers a unique blend that I haven't found anywhere else. It's a city that never ceases to surprise me, where every soi (street) holds new discoveries, even after years of living here.</p>

<p>The Thai people's warmth and their sabai-sabai (easy-going) approach to life has taught me valuable lessons about balance and happiness. Despite being a massive metropolis, Bangkok has a way of feeling like a collection of small communities, each with its own character and charm.</p>

<p><img src="/10-years-in-asia/bangkok-from-the-sky.webp" alt="Bangkok from the Sky" /></p>

<p>What started as a two-month adventure has evolved into a decade-long journey across Asia, ultimately leading me to find my home in <strong>Thailand</strong>. Looking back, that chance conversation at a Madrid meetup didn't just introduce me to the concept of digital nomadism - it opened the door to a life I never imagined possible.</p>

<p>These ten years have been more than just travel; they've been a journey of personal growth, professional development, and cultural understanding. While I don't know what the next decade holds, I'm grateful for every moment of this Asian adventure, and especially for finding my place in the <strong>City of Angels, Bangkok</strong>.</p>
