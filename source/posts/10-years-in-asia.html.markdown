A decade ago, if someone had told me I'd spend the next ten years of my life exploring and living across Asia, I probably wouldn't have believed them. Yet here I am, looking back at a journey that transformed not just my career, but my entire perspective on life and work.

## The Beginning

It all began in Madrid, where I was working as a Software Engineer, following what many would consider a "traditional" career path. During a local tech meetup, a casual conversation introduced me to the concept of *"Digital Nomads"* - a term I'd never heard before. The speaker mentioned an organized trip called [Hacker Paradise](https://www.hackerparadise.org/){:target="_blank"}, offering a two-month stay in **Bali** and **Chiang Mai**. Something about it instantly captured my imagination.

Without much hesitation, I applied for the program. When the acceptance email arrived, reality hit: I needed to convince my employer to let me work remotely for two months. Looking back, that conversation with my boss was the first step toward a completely different life.

Before this adventure, my travel experience was limited to the usual European city breaks with friends, a holiday in **Japan**, and a week-long trip to **San Francisco** for a *Ruby* conference. But this was different. I was about to spend two months in countries I knew little about, working while exploring places I'd only seen in travel blogs and magazines.

The first month in **Ubud, Bali**, was like stepping into another world. The lush greenery, ancient temples, and the unique blend of traditional and digital nomad culture created an environment I'd never experienced before. Then came **Chiang Mai, Thailand**, with its perfect mix of ancient culture and modern amenities. Being surrounded by other remote workers, developers, and digital entrepreneurs showed me a different way of living and working.

The most profound impact wasn't just the places themselves, but the people I met. Here were individuals from all over the world who had broken free from the traditional 9-to-5 office life, creating successful careers while exploring the world. Their stories, achievements, and lifestyles opened my eyes to possibilities I never knew existed.

When I returned to Spain, I knew my life would never be the same. The comfort of home felt different now - not uncomfortable, but somehow incomplete. My mind was already planning the next adventure, not just for a few months, but permanently.

## A Journey Across Continents

Six months after my return to Spain, I embarked on what would become a year-long journey across Southeast Asia. This time, I approached travel differently - slowly and deliberately. Each destination became more than just a place to visit; it became a temporary home.

**Ko Lanta's** peaceful beaches and **Bangkok's** vibrant streets in **Thailand**. The bustling energy of **Ho Chi Minh City** in **Vietnam**. The digital nomad haven of **Canggu** and the paradise-like **Gili Islands** in **Bali**. The ultra-modern cities of **Japan, South Korea, and Singapore**. Each location offered its unique flavor of life, and I stayed anywhere from two weeks to several months, depending on how deeply the place resonated with me.

After nine months of Asian exploration, I briefly returned to Spain to reconnect with family before joining something completely different - the [Nomad Cruise](https://www.nomadcruise.com/){:target="_blank"}. Sailing from **Las Palmas in Gran Canaria to Santo Domingo** in the **Dominican Republic**, we stopped at Caribbean jewels like **St. Martin, Antigua, St. Lucia, and Barbados**. These were places I'd only dreamed of visiting, yet there I was, working from paradise.

Following the cruise, I found myself in **San Jose**, a beautiful beach place in my hometown that offered a perfect winter retreat. But Asia called again, this time leading me to join [Remote Explorers](https://remoteexplorers.com/){:target="_blank"} for two months in the **Indian Himalayas** - an experience that added yet another dimension to my journey.

The next phase of my journey took me to **Penang, Malaysia**, before I finally settled in **Chiang Mai, Thailand**, for two years. This longer stay provided a perfect base for exploring more of Southeast Asia: the charming cities of Vietnam like **Danang, Dalat, Hoi An, and Hanoi**; the modern metropolis of **Taipei** in Taiwan; the multicultural hub of **Kuala Lumpur**; the laid-back capital of Laos, **Vientiane**; the vibrant city of **Hong Kong**; and even ventures into China's massive cities of **Beijing and Shanghai**.

In 2020, a new chapter began when I accepted a job in **Bangkok**, where I've been based ever since - except for a memorable six-month escape to **Ko Samui** during the Covid pandemic, where I lived in what I can only describe as my dream villa.

## Finding Home in Thailand

After experiencing so many incredible places across Asia, it's **Thailand**, and particularly **Bangkok**, that has captured my heart these past five years. There's something special about this country that goes beyond its famous beaches, temples, and food.

**Bangkok**, with its perfect chaos of traditional markets and modern skyscrapers, of street food vendors and high-end restaurants, of ancient temples and contemporary art galleries, offers a unique blend that I haven't found anywhere else. It's a city that never ceases to surprise me, where every soi (street) holds new discoveries, even after years of living here.

The Thai people's warmth and their sabai-sabai (easy-going) approach to life has taught me valuable lessons about balance and happiness. Despite being a massive metropolis, Bangkok has a way of feeling like a collection of small communities, each with its own character and charm.

What started as a two-month adventure has evolved into a decade-long journey across Asia, ultimately leading me to find my home in **Thailand**. Looking back, that chance conversation at a Madrid meetup didn't just introduce me to the concept of digital nomadism - it opened the door to a life I never imagined possible.

These ten years have been more than just travel; they've been a journey of personal growth, professional development, and cultural understanding. While I don't know what the next decade holds, I'm grateful for every moment of this Asian adventure, and especially for finding my place in the **City of Angels, Bangkok**.
